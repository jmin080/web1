The World Wide Web (WWW)
commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and
 other web resources are identified by
Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which
 may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1]
The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application
called a web browser.
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote
the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.
[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in 1991
